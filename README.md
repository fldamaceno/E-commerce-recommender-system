# E-commerce-recommender-system
This repository will host the code for my specialization course final project on reinforcement learning based recommender system.

This project aims to develop an offline recommender system and compare the performance of 3 reinforcement learning algorithms as a Multi-Armed Bandits problem.
For this purpose, an e-commerce dataset will be used, with users, transactions, items and items categories/properties.

The performance will mainly be assessed on transactions rewards, though other metrics will also be used.

The original dataset can be found in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset/data
